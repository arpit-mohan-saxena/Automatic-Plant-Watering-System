Automatic Plant Watering System (IoT-Based)

An intelligent IoT solution designed to automate plant watering using real-time soil moisture monitoring. This system helps maintain ideal moisture levels in the soil, reduces water wastage, and ensures plant health — perfect for home gardens, greenhouses, and smart agriculture.

🚀 Features
🌱 Soil Moisture Detection
Continuously monitors the soil moisture using a sensor.

💧 Automatic Watering
Activates the water pump when moisture levels fall below a set threshold.

🔋 Low Power Consumption
Efficient design with minimal energy usage — ideal for battery-powered setups.

📡 Real-Time Monitoring (Optional)
Integrates with IoT platforms (like Blynk, ThingSpeak, or MQTT) for remote access and monitoring.

⚙️ Customizable Thresholds
Easily configurable soil moisture thresholds via code or app (if IoT-enabled).
